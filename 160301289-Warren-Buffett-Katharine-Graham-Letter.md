PENSIONS

There are two aspects of the pension cost problem upon which management can have a significant impact: (1) maintaining rational control over pension plan promises to employees and (2) increasing investment returns on pension plan assets.

The Irreversible Nature of Pension Promises

To control promises rationally, it is necessary to understand the basic arithmetic and practical rules governing pension plans.

The first thing to recognize, with every pension benefit decision, is that you almost certainly are playing for keeps and won't be able to reverse your decision subsequently if it produces subnormal profitability.

As a practical matter, it is next to impossible to decrease pension benefits in a large profitable company ~ or even a large marginal one. The plan may embody language unequivocally declaring the company's right to terminate at any time and providing that contributions shall be solely at the option of the company. But the law has eroded much of the significance such "out" clauses were presumed to have, and operating practicalities render any residual rights to terminate moot.

So, rule number one regarding pension costs has to be to know what you are getting into before signing up. Look before you leap. There probably is more managerial ignorance on pension costs than any other cost item of remotely similar magnitude. And, as will become so expensively clear to citizens in future decades, there has been even greater electorate ignorance of governmental pension costs. Actuarial thinking simply is not intuitive to most minds. The lexicon is arcane, the numbers seem unreal, and making promises never quite triggers the visceral response evoked by writing a check.

In no other managerial area can such huge aggregate Liabilities - which will be reflected in progressively increasing annual costs and cash requirements - be created so quickly and with so little immediate financial pain. Like pressroom Labor practices, small errors will compound. Care and caution are in order.

Deceptive Arithmetic of "Promise Now - Pay Later"

If you promise to pay me $500 per month for life, you have just extended - actuarially but, nevertheless, in a totally tangible sense - about $65,000. If you are financially good for such a lifetime promise, you would be better off (if I have an average expectancy regarding longevity for one my age) handing me a check for $50,000. But it wouldn't feel the same.

So what is really happening? You just shifted all of your payments up front into future decades! That's deferred costs; they haven't gone away - and if actuarial realities aren't too bad, you still have to come up with those $65,000. And if there are unforeseeable adverse developments (e.g., longer-than-anticipated life expectancy, lower investment returns), the ultimate cost could more than double!

You have shifted your costs into a far distant future and, as such, have gotten a huge price break on today's costs! This is the same time value of money that makes it rational to pay a little bit now in order to save many dollars later. So you may feel like a genius when you first cut the check, but, unless your actuaries can see crystal balls, you are setting up future costs with no provision for dealing with them when they become due ~ and, as will be so painfully demonstrated in public and private pension plans alike, this is exactly what happened.

But it's a deal that will ultimately have to be honored! And, as we will see, even if you can technically change the terms of your promises as you go along (and there will be legal and political ramifications), your ability to do so becomes more constrained the longer you wait. So what is your first rule? Don't make any unrealistic pension commitments!

The Investment Conundrum

To keep costs down, management must become a good investor. This is not as easy as it sounds. The cost of funds is but one aspect to consider. There are more subtle issues:

1. Pension plans have long time horizons and must be willing to take on some market risk to meet their obligations over the extended period ahead; thus, they have a higher average expected return than most investors. And if you are going to shoot for above-average returns, there is more room for error in your selection process!

2. Pension funds can seldom buy or sell large enough blocks of securities to influence the market; thus, they often must rely on indirect participation through mutual funds and other types of pooled investment vehicles. This dilutes their ability to select securities. And the higher the level of indirect investment in a portfolio, the lesser is the impact of even superior security selection skills!

3. The "efficient market hypothesis" (EMH) - an idea gaining increasing acceptance among economists - suggests that all publicly traded securities are subject to random price movements (i.e., unpredictable) over short periods, but tend to revert to some long-term mean level of return in the aggregate. If this is true, how can anyone consistently beat the averages? The answer is: it's very difficult!

4. Most pension plans have no special expertise or resources that would enable them to take on more market risk than most investors and yet succeed with superior security selection.

5. Investment consultants, often hired to provide advice on investing pension plan assets, can be a mixed blessing. While they may bring some valuable insights and research capabilities to the table, they also have conflicts of interest in that their fees are based on assets under management. If they recommend an investment option that proves unprofitable, they still get paid! They, too, are prone to the same kinds of human frailties as pension fund trustees and other decision makers. And they often make more money when assets are shifted into riskier investments!

So, what is your second rule? Don't take on undue investment risk you can't afford or that you can't realistically manage in terms of the long-term nature of pension liabilities.

Pension plans have been and will continue to be plagued by poor accounting, adverse selection, fraud, political pressures, and an array of other problems. But there are two key steps you can take to minimize your costs:

1. Don't make unrealistic promises! Understand the implications of every benefit decision; consider all aspects carefully before committing yourself (or even suggesting such a commitment to others).

2. Don't take on undue investment risk you can't afford or that you can't realistically manage in terms of the long-term nature of pension liabilities.

And, if you promise to pay me 1,000 hamburgers a month for life, which superficially may sound equivalent to the previous proposition (assuming a present hamburger price of 50¢), you have created an obligation which, in an inflationary world, becomes most difficult to evaluate. This creates a risk we talk of later as an "earthquake risk".

One thing is certain. You won't find an insurance company willing to take the 1,000-hamburgers-a-month obligation off your hands for $65,000 - or even $130,000. While hamburgers equate to 50¢ now, the promise to pay hamburgers in the future does not equate to the promise to pay fifty-cent pieces in the future.

So, before plans are introduced or amended, the financial consequences (particularly in a world of significant inflation which I believe to be close to a certainty) should be clearly understood by you. Consulting actuaries are very good at making calculations. They are frequently terrible at making the assumptions upon which the calculations are based. In fact, they well may be peculiarly ill-equipped to make the most important assumptions if the world is one of economic discontinuities. They are trained to be conventional. Their self-interest in obtaining and retaining business would be ill-served if they were to become more than mildly unconventional. And being conventional on the crucial assumptions basically means accepting historical experience adjusted by a moderate nudge from current events.

This works fine in forecasting such factors as mortality and morbidity, works reasonably well on items such as employee turnover, and can be a disaster in estimating: the two most important elements of the pension cost equation, which are fund earnings and salary escalation.

Illustrated Elemental Actuarial Principles

To illustrate a few actuarial principles worth understanding, but without employing the technical jargon and the asterisks, let's use the example of your household. Assume that you, personally, make irrevocable promises to pay pensions of $300 per month for Life after they reach 65 to, say, four household employees. To make it easy, let's say that they each are 55 years of age at present. If you make that promise today, you have reduced your net worth today by about *, My views regarding inflationary possibilities are more extreme than those of most respected observers. It is difficult to substantiate a dogmatic view, since conclusions rest more upon social and political judgments than upon economic training and analysis. You should recognize the subjective nature of the reasoning leading to my pessimistic conclusions regarding inflation over the longer term - and not be reluctant to correct accordingly."

Why are you immediately $70,000 poorer? Well, if you set aside a $70,000 fund now and invest it at 7% interest - and let all such interest remain in the fund to be compounded - the principal value of the fund will grow to about $140,000 in ten years when your employees reach 65. And to buy them a lifetime annuity of $3,600 per year will then cost about $35,000 each, utilizing the entire accumulated capital of the fund. So if you make the promise and it is binding - legally or morally - figure you have spent today $70,000, even though you don't have to pay out a dime of cash for ten years.
Now take it one step further and assume that your employees each are earning $600 per month but, instead of promising them $300 per month upon retirement, you promise them 50% of their salary at the time they retire. If their increases run 7.2% per year - and they probably will in the world I foresee - they will be earning $1,200 per month by the time they reach 65. And it will now cost you $70,000 each to purchase annuities for them to fulfill your promise. The actual cost, today, of modifying your promise from 50% of present pay to 50% of terminal pay was to exactly double the fund that needed to be set aside now from $70,000 to $140,000.
Many pension plans use final average pay (usually the average of the last five years, or the highest consecutive five years in the last ten years employed) and some use career average pay. I am not arguing here which should be used, but am illustrating the dramatic difference in costs that can occur because of rather minor-appearing changes in wording.
Pension costs in a labor intensive business clearly can be of major size and an important variable in the cost picture, particularly in a world characterized by high rates of inflation. I emphasize the latter factor to the point of redundancy because most managements I know - and virtually all elected officials in the case of governmental plans - simply never fully grasp the magnitude of liabilities they are incurring by relatively painless current promises. In many cases in the public area the bill in large part will be handed to the next generation, to be paid by increased taxes or by accelerated use of the printing press. But in a corporation the bill will have to be paid out of current and future revenues - with interest - and frequently with what is, in effect, a cost-of-living escalator.
The same arithmetic applies on a much larger scale when the employer is a government rather than a private business. There the promises are being made to millions of people, their families, and - in some cases (particularly if public pension plans are allowed to invest in non-productive assets) - the bureaucrats who manage the funds. When you add up all those liabilities they can become almost unimaginably large. The state of California's public employee retirement system, for example, has an estimated $250 billion dollar deficit (and one would not want to be too optimistic about the future returns from assets that are expected to produce more than half of the funds needed to meet the promised payments). And the same arithmetic applies to the federal government's pension promises to its employees, and to Social Security.
To illustrate still further what I am talking about here, consider the case of New York City, where the unfunded liability of the city's pension system is estimated at $75 billion (again, that is an estimate; reality may be more). It now costs the city around $2.4 billion a year to make all its pension payments and service the debt. If you think for a moment about the arithmetic of that situation - which can be multiplied many times over in the case of state and federal programs - you will realize why politicians are so interested, as they should be, in exploring every possible way to reduce this burden. If current tax revenues were plowed back into the fund at an annual 7% interest (which is not an unreasonable estimate) it would take approximately 30 years to close the gap entirely - and that assumes there will be no future increases in benefit promises or cost-of-living adjustments. But politicians are not allowed, as a practical matter, to make such promises or commitments far into the future. They have been elected with promises of improvements in this year's budget and next year's, and the year after that. And they must face the voters again soon enough to be accountable for what happens during their term(s) in office.
Therefore, if you are a manager or trustee of a pension fund, your first step should be to determine what future liabilities are reasonably predictable - and what is reasonable will depend on inflation expectations, as well as other factors such as medical advances or productivity growth that may affect life spans and retirement ages. You must then calculate the present value of those projected future expenditures, discounting them back to their present worth using a discount rate appropriate for the risks involved.
But even more important than the arithmetic is the need to think through all the policy issues arising from these promises that have already been made - and which are inevitably being underfunded if we assume, as I do, that the promises made will be kept, or at least not altered in any material respect. For example, should benefits be adjusted for changes in life expectancy? What is an appropriate cost-of-living escalator? (If there were no inflation, would it still make sense to provide a 3% cost of living adjustment every year - or should the adjustment be based on a different measure of prices?) And so on. The real task here is not to compute the present value of future expenditures but rather to confront the policy issues that must be decided, and to develop an approach to decisionmaking that takes account of all the relevant factors.
One final point: this is not just a matter for accountants or actuaries. It is a fundamental issue of public policy, with large implications for the allocation of resources in the economy as well as for taxing and spending priorities. Moreover, it is an area where private enterprise has had remarkable success in creating wealth and providing valuable goods and services to consumers - so that there are many lessons we can learn from studying how private employers have dealt with similar issues in their own pension plans and other benefits programs. This is an area where government, which has a bad track record of managing large-scale economic enterprises, should be careful not to interfere excessively with the market processes that have created so much prosperity and progress in other areas.
Let me repeat: this is not a matter of simply setting aside some money each year and hoping for the best. It requires a thoughtful approach to policy issues that are central to our economic future, as well as a willingness to confront the political difficulties involved in making the necessary adjustments. But to do less would be irresponsible in the extreme."
In Germany, in the great inflation of the early 1920s, the entire Daimler Benz (Mercedes) Automobile Company was selling in the market for the price of 300 motor cars. Almost all past investments were nearly worthless, and current salary levels were astronomical in relation to past history. Under such conditions, or conditions far short of such an extreme, the burden of any pension benefits owed by a business, which are based on current salary levels though related to much earlier service in employment, must be backed almost exclusively by the current value (earning power) of the business. Advance funding simply evaporates. 
For example, assume that salaries (and the cost of living) are moving upward at 25% per year and the pension fund is earning 10% per year - a set of assumptions not ridiculously different from what exists in England at the moment. Under such conditions, funds put aside for retirement immediately begin to shrink in relation to promised benefits. Every month fewer hamburgers can be purchased from the funds contributed to the pension plan - even after accumulating dividends and interest on the funds. 
Almost no one chooses to think about this sort of "earthquake risk" in dealing with pension plans, any more than people choose to spend much time thinking about nuclear war. It may be my earlier-mentioned bias, or my mathematical bent, but I believe some "unthinkable" inflation-related calculations should be made - and even considered - before any company assumes open-ended pension obligations guaranteeing a large number of persons absolute protection against inflation by gearing benefits without limit to final pay or escalating benefits to persons already retired, based on changes in the cost of Living.

Thus, the really devastating possibility regarding private pension plans is sustained double-digit inflation. When salaries move ahead at a substantially higher rate than investment returns and benefits are tied to final salaries (or, even more expensively, cost-of-Living increases after retirement as in recent rubber and aluminum contracts), it is virtually impossible to pre-fund obligations. Like it or not, you become much like the Social Security Fund, absent the power to tax. Should that occur, future purchasers of the products of the company must be willing to do so at prices that reflect not only the wages of current workers, but the promises to past workers. Some businesses will have economic characteristics allowing them to pass along these costs, but others will have major troubles. On balance, I believe we are in relatively favorable businesses under the circumstances.

In this case, the author is discussing the potential risks of private pension plans and the impact of inflation on their funding. The author argues that high inflation can make it impossible to pre-fund pension obligations, and that current salary levels may not be sustainable in the long term. The author suggests that businesses should consider the potential risks of inflation when making decisions about pension plans, and that advance funding may not be sufficient to cover future obligations.

The Investment Management Problem Inherent in All Pension Plans 

Once having committed to provide pensions, how do we pay? The law and prudent business practice mandate that we start putting aside funds on a fairly orderly and consistent basis from which we can fulfill our promises. In this manner, we pay the employee currently while he is being productive for the company, and simultaneously set up a savings account (collectively, not individually) which will accumulate at interest so as to purchase an annuity (not actually "purchased" in most plans, of course, just assured by the pension fund) for him at retirement, which will discharge our promise to pay him throughout his non-productive years. Thus, our current cost and current cash requirements (if our estimates are accurate as to what we will earn on the savings account as well as other estimates regarding turnover, salary escalation, longevity, etc.) will reflect his total lifetime employment costs to us spread rather evenly over his productive years. 
(This advance funding treatment, matching full current costs against current production, contrasts with the Social Security Plan's program which essentially taxes current producers to pay current non-producers. This simply means moving a portion of current national output of goods and services over from those who produced it to those who are non-producing, and to whom promises have been made. If such a system had been in effect for a very long time, the demographic profile remained fairly constant, the promises remained fairly constant, and there was no inflation, the net effect from such a pay-as-you-go approach would not substantially differ from an advance funding basis.
However, these conditions do not exist which may make for various problems - including some that exacerbate inflation and thus have negative fallout for the economics of private plans.)
Because a business corporation, unlike the Federal government, has to create a "savings account" - an investment accumulating and investment earning funds - it must take into account this fact when projecting and budgeting for future pension costs. It's an investment management problem, not simply a matter of writing promises on paper and forgetting about them later. For example, it is likely that the company will have to:
- Invest in stocks and bonds so that the savings account grows at rates sufficient to meet projected future pension liabilities. 
- Periodically review the investment portfolio to rebalance asset classes and/or change managers (to "beat the benchmark" or to avoid underperformance).
- Select which inflation-fighting strategies work best, for instance, TIPS vs. I Bonds.
- Consider the actuarial assumptions used in estimating future pension liabilities such as mortality rates, turnover, salary escalation, etc., and to select appropriate discount rates. 
- Monitor the actual results of their investment program relative to the desired objectives, make adjustments when necessary and periodically revaluate the long term rate of return that can be expected from the pension plan's investments.
This investment management problem is inherent in all pension plans (private or public) and must be addressed by those responsible for managing such funds.
Conclusion 
We hope this article has helped to explain some of the complexities of company-sponsored pension plans and their associated investment management problems which are inherent in all pension plans. The law requires that companies make promises to their employees that they will provide a pension, but it does not require them to fund those promises immediately. However, responsible business practice dictates that such promises be funded over time so as to fulfill the company's obligations. This article has explored some of the issues that must be considered in managing investments for a pension plan and emphasizes that this is an ongoing problem which requires careful attention by those responsible for such plans.
